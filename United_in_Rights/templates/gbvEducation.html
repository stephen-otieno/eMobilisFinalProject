     <h1> <u>GENDER BASED VIOLENCE EDUCATION</u> </h1>

<p><b>What is GBV?</b>
Gender-Based Violence (GBV) refers to harmful acts directed at individuals based on their gender.
    It stems from unequal power relationships between genders, cultural norms, and societal expectations, making it a critical human rights and public health issue.
    GBV disproportionately affects women and girls but can impact anyone, including men, boys, and individuals of diverse gender identities.

    <h3><u>Types of Gender Based Violence</u></h3> <br><br>

 <div class="Desc1">

        <ul>
     <li><b>Physical Violence</b></li>
        It involves the intentional use of physical force to cause harm, injury, or death. Examples include hitting, kicking, slapping, choking, and other forms of assault.
        It often occurs within intimate relationships (domestic violence) but can also manifest in public settings.
        Physical violence leaves visible injuries but can also cause long-term psychological trauma.
        Femicide, the killing of women because of their gender, is an extreme manifestation of this violence.


     <li> <b>Sexual Violence</b> </li>


        Encompasses any sexual act or attempt to obtain a sexual act without consent. This includes rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and coercion.
        It can occur in private (within families, relationships) or public spaces (workplaces, streets). Human trafficking and forced prostitution are also forms of sexual violence.
        Survivors often face stigma, leading to underreporting of cases. Sexual violence is a profound violation of autonomy and dignity, often resulting in severe physical and emotional scars.


    <li> <b>Psychological Violence</b> </li>
        Psychological violence involves actions or words intended to harm a person's mental well-being or sense of self-worth. Examples include verbal abuse, threats, controlling behaviors, and intimidation.
        Gas lighting—manipulating someone into questioning their perceptions—is a common tactic. Psychological violence often accompanies other forms of GBV, compounding its effects.
        Its impact can be long-lasting, leading to anxiety, depression, and diminished self-confidence.


    <li> <b>Harmful Cultural Practices</b></li>
        Certain cultural norms and traditions perpetuate GBV through practices that are harmful to individuals, particularly women and girls. These include child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM), honor-based violence, and dowry-related violence.
        Such practices are deeply rooted in societal norms and are often justified by tradition, despite violating human rights. Efforts to eliminate these practices require culturally sensitive approaches that promote education and alternative rites of passage.

   <li> <b>Economic Violence</b></li>
        Economic violence occurs when one person controls or limits another's access to financial resources, thereby making them financially dependent. Examples include withholding money, preventing someone from working, or sabotaging their career opportunities.
        This form of violence disproportionately affects women, as they are more likely to face financial restrictions in abusive relationships. Economic abuse traps individuals in cycles of dependence, making it difficult to leave
